## Features

  header. These elements should be defined in `[menu.main]` on the
  `config.toml` file.
- It includes a sticky footer. You can use social media links on the footer
  defining `[params.social]` on the `config.toml` file. The icons are used from
  [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/)`.
